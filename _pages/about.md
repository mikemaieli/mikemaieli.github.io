My name is Mike Maieli and I am a data analyst and data visualization designer. I  conceptualize information, data, and ideas  to engage audiences and inspire action. Through data visualization, I am able to help identify and communicate thought-provoking data points to help paint a story, give validity, and add perspective to the many decisions we make. I am always willing to collaborate, so please feel free to reach out.
