### I create infographics.
**Have a large report but worried that your audience won't read or engage?** A one or two (or three) page designed document can help bridge the gap between a more detailed report and a time-limited audience. I can turn your story into a digestible and engaging form that can help you deliver your message beyond a lengthy report.


### I build custom data visualizations.
**Want to show your data in a creative way?** I can design a custom static visualization that can help to draw interest to your data or clearly show key insights to your audience. Whether it is one graph or an abstract representation of the data, I can work with you to achieve your goals through data visualization.


### I design presentations and slide decks.
**Do you need to deliver a pitch, keynote, or a slide deck but do not have the time or resources to design visuals that do your story justice?** I will design a custom set of slides that will complement your presentation and provide supporting information in a clean, clear, and crisp way for your audience. I can also create content heavy slides used for PDF'ing or distribution.
