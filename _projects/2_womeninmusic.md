#### Project Overview

A team of Berklee researchers partnered with Women in Music to survey the socioeconomic landscape of women working in the U.S. music industry. Almost 2,000 responses were collected, analyzed, and by the research team. My role was to lead the layout and design of the final report, infographic, and slide decks used to present the research at various conferences including SXSW. The purpose of this work was to ensure this resarch, analysis, and report writing from the research team was visually engaging and inspiring.

#### Report Design
My process included creating a base template for the report, fine tuning each page, creating data visualizations to communicate key messages in the data, and tying in quotes to capture the personal nature of the research.

#### Research Summary
In addition, I created a four page infographic that went through multiple iterations. I had initially created a less dense version, but the infographic is intentionally text heavy to ensure that readers and press who only will look at the infographic will understand the key findings from the report.
