#### Project Overview

ApptNow is a fictional tech start-up looking to raise money to build a company that helps people schedule medical appointments online. ApptNow needed a pitch deck to help them acquire a new round of funding. The deck below was designed to succinctly inform potential investors about ApptNow's growth opportunity and how an investment would lead to the company's success. My design is based on the company's branding and uses a unified structure, imagery, and data visualization to tell their story.
